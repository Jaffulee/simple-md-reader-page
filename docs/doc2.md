## Tips

> Keep docs in `/docs/` and update `_docs.json` (or auto-generate it with GitHub Actions).

> Use tooltips for context: Modern systems often expose <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An application programming interface (API) is a way for an application to request a service from another application. APIs enable developers to avoid rebuilding application features that already exist. An API endpoint is the place where those requests (known as API calls) are fulfilled.">
